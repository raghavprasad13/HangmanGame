# HangmanGame
Hangman for iOS

Currently has no functionality and is only a display of the layout of the game  
The UI is temporary and serves merely to display the layout of the game

Need to figure out how to hook up buttons with their respective onClick functions  
Once that is done, the game can be quickly completed and finalized
